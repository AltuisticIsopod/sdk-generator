## Getting Started

### Making Changes

When contributing to a repository, the first step is to open an issue on [sdk-generator](https://{{gitHost}}/{{gitUserId}}/sdk-generator) to discuss the change you wish to make before making them.

### Opening Issues

Before you submit a new issue please make sure to search all open and closed issues. It is possible your feature request/issue has already been answered.  Make sure to also check the [OpenFGA discussions](https://{{gitHost}}/orgs/{{gitUserId}}/discussions).

That repo includes an issue template that will walk through all the places to check before submitting your issue here. Please follow the instructions there to make sure this is not a duplicate issue and that we have everything we need to research and reproduce this problem.

### Submitting Pull Requests

While we accept Pull Requests on this repository, the SDKs are autogenerated so please consider additionally submitting your Pull Requests to the [sdk-generator](https://{{gitHost}}/{{gitUserId}}/sdk-generator) and linking the two PRs together and to the corresponding issue. This will greatly assist the OpenFGA team in being able to give timely reviews as well as deploying fixes and updates to our other SDKs as well. 

## Getting in touch
