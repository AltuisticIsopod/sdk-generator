## v0.0.1

### [0.0.1](https://{{gitHost}}/{{gitUserId}}/{{gitRepoId}}/releases/tag/v0.0.1) (2023-09-14)

This is an initial beta release. While it can be used to call an FGA server, it lacks conveniences
already present in other OpenFGA SDKs and already planned.

Most notably it lacks a higher-level client (work is in progress), which will be the recommended
entry point.
